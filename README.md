VariableNamingConvention
========================

This  repo contains a web page that explains the Variable Naming Convention I use in most of my PHP projects and code examples.
To link to it from code the following header is recommended:


    /**
     * Note: The variable naming scheme used in this code is an adaption of 
     * Systems Hungarian and explained at http://pother.ca/VariableNamingConvention/
     */
